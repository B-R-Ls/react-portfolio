# React-Portfolio

This Front-end webpage uses react and vite inorder to create my personal portfolio.

## Description

![site](./public/Capture.PNG)

This react based project was a basis on tapping into the knowledge of react based programming. Through this experience i was able to proberly get an understanding of its inner workings. I had little to no problems along, the way other than formating issues and implemenation of certain elements. In the end though i was able to create a sleek website that properly conveys who I am, and how I am as a developer.
